In this module, we will cover:\n\nAn overview of Information Security\nPenetration testing distros\nCommon terms and technologies\nScanning and enumeration basics\nUsing public exploits\nShells, privilege escalation, and transferring files\nNavigating the HTB platform\nA step-by-step walkthrough of a retired HTB box\nCommon pitfalls and asking questions effectively\nCompleting a box without a walkthrough\nNext steps in the field\n\nThis module is broken down into sections with accompanying hands-on exercises to practice each of the tactics and techniques we cover. The module ends with a practical hands-on skills assessment to gauge your understanding of the various topic areas.\n\nAs you work through the module, you will see example commands and command output for the various topics introduced. It is worth reproducing as many of these examples as possible to reinforce further the concepts introduced in each section. You can do this in the Pwnbox provided in the interactive sections or your virtual machine.\n\nYou can start and stop the module at any time and pick up where you left off. There is no time limit or \"grading,\" but you must complete all of the exercises and the skills assessment to receive the maximum number of cubes and have this module marked as complete in any paths you have chosen.\n\nThe module is classified as \"Fundamental\" but assumes a working knowledge of the Linux command line and an understanding of information security fundamentals.\n\nA firm grasp of the following modules can be considered prerequisites for successful completion of this module:\n\nIntroduction to Networking\nLinux Fundamentals\nIntroduction to Web Applications\nWeb Requests\nLearning Process", "sections": [{"_type": "Document", "name": "Infosec Overview"}, {"_type": "Interactive / Exercise", "name": "Getting Started with a Pentest Distro"}, {"_type": "Document", "name": "Staying Organized"}, {"_type": "Document", "name": "Connecting Using VPN"}, {"_type": "Document", "name": "Common Terms"}, {"_type": "Interactive / Exercise", "name": "Basic Tools"}, {"_type": "Interactive / Exercise", "name": "Service Scanning"}, {"_type": "Interactive / Exercise", "name": "Web Enumeration"}, {"_type": "Interactive / Exercise", "name": "Public Exploits"}, {"_type": "Document", "name": "Types of Shells"}, {"_type": "Interactive / Exercise", "name": "Privilege Escalation"}, {"_type": "Document", "name": "Transferring Files"}, {"_type": "Document", "name": "Starting Out"}, {"_type": "Document", "name": "Navigating HTB"}, {"_type": "Interactive / Exercise", "name": "Nibbles - Enumeration"}, {"_type": "Interactive / Exercise", "name": "Nibbles - Web Footprinting"}, {"_type": "Interactive / Exercise", "name": "Nibbles - Initial Foothold"}, {"_type": "Interactive / Exercise", "name": "Nibbles - Privilege Escalation"}, {"_type": "Document", "name": "Nibbles - Alternate User Method - Metasploit"}, {"_type": "Document", "name": "Common Pitfalls"}, {"_type": "Document", "name": "Getting Help"}, {"_type": "Document", "name": "Next Steps"}, {"_type": "Interactive / Exercise", "name": "Knowledge Check"}]}
