## Summary

This module introduces core penetration testing concepts, getting started with Hack The Box, a step-by-step walkthrough of your first HTB box, problem-solving, and how to be successful in general when beginning in the field. In this module, we will cover:

An overview of Information Security
Penetration testing distros
Common terms and technologies
Scanning and enumeration basics
Using public exploits
Shells, privilege escalation, and transferring files
Navigating the HTB platform
A step-by-step walkthrough of a retired HTB box
Common pitfalls and asking questions effectively
Completing a box without a walkthrough
Next steps in the field

This module is broken down into sections with accompanying hands-on exercises to practice each of the tactics and techniques we cover. The module ends with a practical hands-on skills assessment to gauge your understanding of the various topic areas.

As you work through the module, you will see example commands and command output for the various topics introduced. It is worth reproducing as many of these examples as possible to reinforce further the concepts introduced in each section. You can do this in the Pwnbox provided in the interactive sections or your virtual machine.

You can start and stop the module at any time and pick up where you left off. There is no time limit or "grading," but you must complete all of the exercises and the skills assessment to receive the maximum number of cubes and have this module marked as complete in any paths you have chosen.

The module is classified as "Fundamental" but assumes a working knowledge of the Linux command line and an understanding of information security fundamentals.

A firm grasp of the following modules can be considered prerequisites for successful completion of this module:

Introduction to Networking
Linux Fundamentals
Introduction to Web Applications
Web Requests
Learning Process
