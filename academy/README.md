summary: 'Many malicious actors tend to obfuscate their code to avoid it being detected
  by systems or understood by other developers.


  The ability to deobfuscate code is a useful technique that can be applied to various
  real-world scenarios. It is useful on web application assessments to determine if
  a developer has used \"security by obscurity\" to hide JavaScript code containing
  sensitive data. It can also be useful for defenders when, for example, attempting
  to deobfuscate code that was responsible for the Phishing website used in an attack.


  In this module, you will learn the basics of deobfuscating and decoding JavaScript
  code and will have several exercises to practice what you learned.


  You will learn the following topics:


  Locating JavaScript code

  Intro to Code Obfuscation

  How to Deobfuscate JavaScript code

  How to decode encoded messages

  Basic Code Analysis

  Sending basic HTTP requests


  Our final exercise in this module will open a door for many other challenges and
  exercises in Hack The Box!


  Requirements


  It is recommended to take the Web Requests module before this one to get a general
  understanding of how HTTP requests work. If you are already familiar with them,
  then you should be able to start this module.'
