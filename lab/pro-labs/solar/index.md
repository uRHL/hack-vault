## Description


SolarSystem Space Prospection is an innovative young company whose primary mission is pioneering space exploration. While they set off to explore outer space, they want you to explore their infrastructure on Earth in order to assess its security.
The goal is to gain a foothold on the internal network, escalate privileges and ultimately compromise the entire infrastructure, while collecting several flags along the way. This Endgame is designed to test your skills in Enumeration, Code Review, Pivoting, Web Exploitation and other attacking techniques.
In order to stand your ground and soar into the territory of the Solar, players must thoroughly prepare themselves for concepts such as:

Situational Awareness
FreeBSD Exploitation
Exploit Chaining
Out-of-Band Data Exfiltration
Web Application Attacks
Source Code Review
